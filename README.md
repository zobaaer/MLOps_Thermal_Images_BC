# Deep Learning-Based Framework for Breast Cancer Detection   Using Segmented Thermal Images - MLOps Project

This repository provides deep learning pipelines to perform **breast cancer thermography analysis** using PyTorch, developed as part of a project during module TSM_MachLeOps.
It includes:

- **Image Classification** (Low Risk vs High Risk) using ResNet18  
- **Image Segmentation** of thermal abnormalities using R2AttU-Net  
- Integrated with **Weights & Biases (wandb)** for training logs and tracking
